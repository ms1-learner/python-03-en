Create a Python script that provides a simple tool for managing blog posts using the https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts API. The CLI should support the following operations: list, create, update and delete. Feel free to use the functions you created during the exercise on HTTP requests and error handling.

1. Define a function for each operation (list_posts, create_post, update_post, delete_post).
2. Use the requests library to make HTTP requests to the API in each function.
3. Handle input and output in the CLI (e.g., prompt the user for input, print success/error messages).
4. Use a loop to keep the CLI running until the user decides to exit.
