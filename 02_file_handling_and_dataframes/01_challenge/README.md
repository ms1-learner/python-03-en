### **Challenge 1: Python File Handling Adventure**

**Objective:** Create a Python script to manage a collection of text files in a directory.

**Tasks:**

1. **Directory Setup:** Write a script to create a new directory and populate it with at least 10 text files.
2. **File Operations:** Implement functionality to open, read, and append content to these files.
3. **Navigation and Reporting:** Use **`pathlib`** to navigate the directory, listing all files and their sizes.
4. **Exception Handling:** Incorporate exception handling to manage errors like file not found or access denied.
5. **Context Managers:** Ensure all file operations use context managers for safe opening/closing of files.

### **Challenge 2: Data Transformation Wizard**

**Objective:** Write a Python script to convert data between different formats.

**Tasks:**

1. **CSV to JSON:** Read a CSV file, convert its contents to JSON format, and save it as a new file.
2. **JSON to CSV:** Take a JSON file, parse it, and convert the data into CSV format.
3. **Data Validation:** Implement checks to ensure data integrity during conversion (e.g., all rows have the same number of columns).
4. **Automate File Identification:** The script should automatically identify and process all CSV and JSON files in a given directory.

### **Challenge 3: Pandas DataFrames Explorer**

**Objective:** Utilize Pandas to perform data analysis on a provided dataset (in CSV format).

**Tasks:**

1. **Data Loading:** Load the data into a DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Identify and handle missing data in the dataset.
3. **Basic Analysis:** Perform basic data analysis tasks and save them in the predefined descriptive statistics placeholder variables. 
4. **Filtering Data:** Write functions to filter the data based on given criteria (e.g., filter out rows where a certain column's value is below a threshold).
