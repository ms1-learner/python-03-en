### **Challenge 1: Python File Handling Adventure**

**Objective:** Create a collection of short scripts to manage a library of text files. They can be found in at `02_file_handling_and_dataframes/01_challenge/data/text_files`

**Tasks:**

1. **File_Operations:** The first script should import all the files named after books into a python dictionary, and then save it as a single text file. Do not include the chapter files. 
2. **directory_setup:** Write a new script to create a new directory in the `data` folder called `library` and populate it with all 10 chapters in the data folder. Then use **`pathlib`** to navigate the directory, listing all files and their sizes.

Note: Test files are not included for this challenge.
