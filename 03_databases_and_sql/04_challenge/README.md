# Challenge 4: Live Recap

## **All Suppliers**

Write a SQL query to fetch a list of all the supplier names from the Northwind database. Fetch only the supplier names, not all the columns.

## **Small Orders**

Count the number of orders in the database that have fewer than 5 items in total. You'll need to use the **`Orders`** and **`OrderDetails`** tables and sum the quantities for each order. The goal is to get an integer, not a tuple.

## **First Ten Products**

Retrieve the first ten products from the Northwind database, sorted alphabetically by product name.

## **Products with a Keyword**

Fetch product and supplier information for products containing a given keyword in their name (case insensitive). You'll need to join the **`Products`** and **`Suppliers`** tables.

## **Top 5 Categories by Product Count**

Write a function that takes a string argument, **`categoryName`**, and finds the top five categories with the most products. Use SQL to build your query step by step.

These challenges will help you explore the Northwind database's structure and practice SQL queries in a different context.
